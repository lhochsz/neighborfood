# NeighborFood
A web app using MongoDB, Express and NodeJS to reduce food waste and connect neighbors.

## Overview
Missing an ingredient to complete the perfect recipe?  A neighbor might have it.
Have some extra leftovers? A neighbor might want it.
NeighborFood helps to reduce food waste and connect neighbors along the way.

For Project 2 at General Assembly Atlanta, I created a web app for users to enter in their leftovers and extra food items.  The items post to a neighborhood board seen by all users.  The users can contact eachother via email to set up a meeting location to exchange food.
